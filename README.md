# Project Description
250 Word Summary

We realized that students find it hard to study, thatâ€™s why we designed StudyWave. StudyWave is a project we have spent this hackathon working on that allows schools and individuals to study how students learn.
It is quite often that students find themselves trying to learn, but end up forgetting everything they learned the second they need to put it to use. Our goal is that by analyzing study patterns and recall abilities with EEG data, we can help students to learn better.
By using the Muse 2 Brain Headband, we were able to collect data by setting up study environments to test how individuals understand new information. We realized that a lot of information is lost by students who show chaotic brian activity, mostly attributed to loss of focus, unsteadiness and fidgeting, and multi-tasking. Our goal is to help students who run into these loss of focus points, to get back on track. 
We developed code to help pull out these focus points from brain waves, indicating when a student has lost focus, falls into a state of deep understanding, or could use a new environment. 
Our plan is to develop this information into a health application, that can create summaries of your study session, similar to how the running apps track how your run goes. This can provide insight to the efficiency of study among individuals, and could be used by educational institutes to help students who are struggling, learn to learn better. 

Given the time we had, we developed front end concepts, back end communications with the Muse 2 for live EEG streams, sorted outputs to pull out spikes in data indicating points of focus loss, and conducted research on how you can visualize deep focus in the brain through Beta & Gamma waves. 

Note
Backend folder contains Html, CSS, JS, and Python content, it is not fully connected, and has only been fully tested on MacOS. It does not yet display realtime graph, and is only uploaded for sharing purposes. Photos in the Repo show the output + front end concepts.
